# Indico Docker Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Indico using Docker on Ubuntu servers. Indico is a robust event management system developed at CERN, facilitating the organization of conferences, workshops, and meetings.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu Server 20.04 or later
- Docker Engine installed and running
- Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of Docker and Docker Compose

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Indico Docker repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hosseinowji/Indico-docker.git
cd Indico-docker
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file and configure the environment variables as needed. Pay attention to variables related to database passwords, secret keys, and domain settings.

```bash
nano .env
```

## Step 3: Build Docker Containers

Build the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Step 4: Start Docker Containers

Start the Docker containers in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Step 5: Access Indico

Once the containers are up and running, access Indico by navigating to the server's IP address or domain name in a web browser.

```plaintext
http://your_server_ip_or_domain
```

## Step 6: Additional Configuration (Optional)

- **TLS Certificate**: Configure HTTPS by obtaining a valid TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt or any other certificate authority.
- **Customization**: Customize Indico settings, such as branding, authentication methods, and plugins, by modifying the appropriate configuration files.

## Step 7: Maintenance and Upgrades

- **Database Backup**: Set up regular database backups to prevent data loss.
- **Indico Updates**: Monitor Indico's official repository for updates and apply them regularly to keep your installation secure and up to date.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during deployment, refer to the troubleshooting section in the repository or seek assistance from the Indico community.
